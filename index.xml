Welcome to my website.
My name is Faramarz. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer. I am going to, hopefully, write about what I learn or find interesting here, mostly for my reference. But if you stumble upon something on my site that interests you, please feel free to enjoy it, and even share it with others if you like.
Programming is a subject that I like the most to learn about. But I am also very interested in history, different generes of music, and reading books.</description></item></channel></rss>
